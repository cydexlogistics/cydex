# Admin

What admins can see and do, and how it works underneath. Admins log in at `/admin/login` (or the normal login) and land on the Overview.

Most of this lives in migration [`20261008000000_admin_tools.sql`](../supabase/migrations/20261008000000_admin_tools.sql). Every admin function checks the caller is an admin (`require_admin()`), and every admin action is written to the activity log.

Before an action runs, the admin is asked **"Are you sure…?"**. Actions that affect someone else (cancelling, rejecting, suspending, hiding) also need a reason.

## Pages

| Page | What it's for |
|---|---|
| **Overview** | A To do list, money for a chosen period, a chart, live numbers and stuck orders. See below. |
| **Orders** | Every customer order and rider request. Search by order number, customer, vendor, rider or recipient, and filter by status and type. Open an order for its full details and the support actions. |
| **Money** | Six tabs: Earnings (the per-order breakdown), Withdrawals (approve or reject), Wallets, Held funds, Customer payments and Rewards (every reward given out). |
| **Users** | Everyone, with their role, status and verification. Edit a name or phone, suspend or reinstate customers, and invite or remove admins. |
| **Verifications** | Review vendors and riders, and manage business categories. See [VERIFICATION.md](VERIFICATION.md). |
| **Reviews** | Vendor and rider reviews. Hide fake or abusive ones. |
| **Pricing** | The delivery charge, Service Charge and commissions, with the change history. |
| **Riders & vehicles** | The vehicle types riders can register, each with its own price per km, and how long an idle rider stays online. |
| **Promotions** | Two tabs. **General:** discounts and coupon codes for customers, vendors and riders, with limits, optionally only for some email domains. **Vendor partnerships:** partner vendors with their own commission rates, and promotions for customers ordering from them. |
| **Rewards** | Two tabs. **Rewards:** achievements for customers, vendors and riders, and daily or weekly challenges for riders, each with a wallet bonus or a personal offer. **Referrals:** the referral reward and goal for each kind of account, and every referral. See below. |
| **Broadcasts** | Announcements to customers, vendors or riders, as a notification, an email or both. |
| **Messages** | Messages from the website's contact form: reply by email, mark each one unresolved, in progress or resolved, and keep an internal note. A **Newsletter** tab lists sign-ups, with a CSV download. Admins are notified of each new message, and unresolved ones show in the Overview's To do list. |
| **Notifications** | The admin's own notifications (withdrawals to approve, verifications to review), with a bell on mobile. |
| **Emails** | Emails the app sends. Retry failed ones. |
| **Activity log** | Who did what, newest first. |
| **Security** | Placeholder with sample data, kept for planning. Not connected yet. |

Lists show 10 rows per page, here and across the app (`PAGE_SIZE` in [`src/lib/pagination.ts`](../src/lib/pagination.ts)).

## Overview

- **To do:** shows lines like "You have 3 verifications to review" or "You have 2 withdrawal requests waiting for approval", plus stuck orders, orders waiting for a rider and failed emails. Each line links to the right page.
- **Period filter:** All time, This month, Last month, Last 3 months, Last 6 months or Custom dates. It drives the money figures and the chart.
- **Total transactions:** everything paid through Cydex in the period (customer orders and vendors' rider requests), including payments refunded later. The refunded amount is shown underneath.
- **Total revenue (Cydex):** Cydex's cut of orders **delivered** in the period, split by where it came from:
  - **From customers:** the Service Charge.
  - **From vendors:** the commission on items, plus the commission on rider requests.
  - **From riders:** the part of the delivery fee riders don't get (15% today).
  - **From withdrawal fees:** the 1.5% fee on withdrawals that were actually paid out (failed or rejected ones are refunded in full). It covers Squad's per-transfer charge (₦8–₦40), so the real profit is a little lower. Riders and vendors see the fee and what they'll receive before they confirm a withdrawal.
- **Chart:** transactions and revenue, or paid-order counts. It shows one bar per day for periods up to about 3 months, and one per month beyond that.
- **Right now** (not tied to the period): orders today, active deliveries, orders waiting for a rider, riders online, verifications to review, withdrawals to approve, money held for active orders and failed emails.
- **Orders needing attention:** paid orders stuck longer than usual (`admin_orders_needing_attention()`):

  | Status | Flagged after |
  |---|---|
  | Paid, vendor hasn't accepted | 15 min |
  | Accepted, not marked ready | 45 min |
  | Ready, no rider | 20 min |
  | Rider assigned, hasn't set off | 30 min |
  | Rider heading to vendor, not collected | 45 min |
  | Out for delivery | 60 min |
  | Any open order with a locked handover code | right away |

## Money

### Earnings: the breakdown table

One row per delivered order (`admin_earnings()`, built on the `order_money_split` view), with the period's totals at the top and bottom, and a CSV download.

| Column | Customer order | Rider request |
|---|---|---|
| Paid | Items + delivery fee + Service Charge, paid by the customer | Delivery fee + commission, paid by the vendor |
| Vendor got | Items − vendor commission | – |
| Rider got | Rider share of the delivery fee | Same |
| Cydex from customer | Service Charge | – |
| Cydex from vendor | Vendor commission | Rider-request commission |
| Cydex from rider | Delivery fee − rider's share | Same |
| Cydex total | The three above | The three above |

Paid always equals Vendor got + Rider got + Cydex total. Refunded orders aren't listed, because nothing was kept.

### Withdrawals need an admin

Vendors and riders can't request less than **₦3,000** at a time (`app_config.min_payout_amount`).

1. A vendor, rider or customer asks to withdraw. `request_payout` takes the money out of their wallet and records a **pending** request. They're told it's waiting for approval, and all admins get a notification.
2. An admin opens **Money → Withdrawals**. The **Send withdrawals by** switch at the top decides how they're paid (`app_config.payout_method`, migration [`20261030100000_manual_payouts.sql`](../supabase/migrations/20261030100000_manual_payouts.sql)):
   - **Manual bank transfer** (the default until Squad enables transfers for Cydex's account): **Pay manually** shows the amount to send and their bank details, with copy buttons. Send it from Cydex's bank account, tick "I've sent it", optionally add the bank's transfer reference and a note, and **Mark as paid** (`admin_mark_payout_paid`). It becomes **Paid** right away, they're told it's been sent, and it shows "Paid by manual bank transfer" with the reference. Squad transfers are refused while this is on.
   - **Squad** — **Approve:** `squad-payout` (`action: 'approve'`) sends the Squad transfer. Two admins can't send the same one twice. If Squad rejects the transfer, the money goes back to the wallet.
   - **Reject** (with a reason): `admin_reject_payout`. The request becomes `cancelled`, the money goes back, and they're told why.
   - **Check status:** asks Squad about a transfer that's still processing. You rarely need it, because of the automatic check below.
3. **Finishing is automatic.** If Squad confirms the transfer straight away, it's marked **Paid** on approval. Otherwise a scheduled job (`payout-status-sweep`, every 10 minutes) checks every withdrawal still "sent" with Squad. Each one becomes **Paid**, or **Failed** with the money returned, and the rider or vendor is notified. Only paid withdrawals count towards withdrawal-fee revenue.

### Pricing

Each save adds a new `pricing_config` row (`admin_update_pricing`), with who changed it and an optional note. New orders use the newest row; orders already placed keep the prices they were charged. The page shows a worked example with the new prices.

| Setting | Allowed |
|---|---|
| Delivery charge (added to every delivery; ₦500) | ₦0 – ₦100,000 |
| Service Charge, vendor commission, rider-request commission | 0 – 50% |
| Rider share of the delivery fee | 50 – 100% |

**Delivery fee = distance × the vehicle type's price per km + the delivery charge.** The price per km is set for each vehicle type on **Riders & vehicles**; there's no minimum fare.

### Riders & vehicles

Migration [`20261013000000_vehicles_categories_hours.sql`](../supabase/migrations/20261013000000_vehicles_categories_hours.sql).

- **Vehicle types:** Walking (customers see "EcoChampions"), Bicycle, Petrol bike and Electric bike to start with. Add more or edit them. For each one:
  - **Price per km**, used for the delivery fee.
  - **Longest trip**, pickup to drop-off, in km (5 to start with). Riders with this vehicle only see deliveries up to this distance, customers can only pick it for trips this short, and customers see vendors as far away as the longest trip of any active type. See [ORDER_FLOW.md → How far each mode goes](ORDER_FLOW.md#how-far-each-mode-goes).
  - **Average speed**, used for delivery time estimates until the type has 5 real deliveries.
  - **Sees new orders within** and **Alerted to new orders within** (km of the pickup, 5 to start with; the alert distance can't be more than the first). Riders with this vehicle only see orders ready for pickup within the first distance, and get the "Order nearby" alert within the second. Keep both small for walking riders (migration [`20261025100000_partnerships_and_order_radius.sql`](../supabase/migrations/20261025100000_partnerships_and_order_radius.sql)).
  - **What riders must give:** nothing (walking); colour and a photo of the vehicle; or also the registration number and registration document.
  - **Name customers see**, if different.
  - **Active:** riders can register with it and customers can pick it as their preferred delivery mode.
- **Idle riders:** the number of minutes a rider can show as available without taking an order before they're set offline (30 to start with; 0 switches it off). They come back online when they open the app again.

### Promotions

Migration [`20261013400000_promotions.sql`](../supabase/migrations/20261013400000_promotions.sql). **Admin → Promotions → New promotion.**

Audiences and limits: migration [`20261014100000_promotion_audience_limits.sql`](../supabase/migrations/20261014100000_promotion_audience_limits.sql).

| Field | Choices |
|---|---|
| **Who it's for** | Customers, vendors, riders or everyone. This decides what it can take money off. |
| **What it takes money off** | **Customers:** the Service Charge, the delivery fee, or the items of one business. **Vendors:** the Request Rider delivery fee, the Request Rider commission, or the commission on their sales. **Riders:** the commission on their deliveries. |
| **Discount** | A percentage, or a flat amount in naira |
| **Who pays for it** | Cydex, or the business (items only) |
| **Limits** | **Only the first … people**, and **Uses for each person**. Leave either empty for no limit. |
| **Coupon code** | Leave empty for a promotion that applies by itself; enter a code to make people type it. Commission promotions can't have a code. |
| **Conditions** | Maximum distance in km; one or more delivery modes (rider groups) |
| **Dates** | Start and end |
| **Only for emails at** (General tab, optional) | Email domains, for example `gmail.com, ui.edu.ng`. Only people whose email ends with one of them get it; `ui.edu.ng` also covers `student.ui.edu.ng`. |
| **Show in "Offers for you"** | On to start with. Off: it isn't listed on home pages or among the codes at checkout. A hidden coupon still works for anyone given the code; a hidden automatic promotion still applies by itself. |

- An order gets one discount on what's paid: a valid coupon first, otherwise the promotion that saves the most. A commission promotion for the vendor or rider can apply on top.
- **Limits count paid orders that aren't cancelled.** Cancelling or refunding an order gives the use back.
- The list shows each promotion's state (scheduled, running, fully claimed, ended, off), who it's for, and how many times and by how many people it's been used.
- People see every promotion they can still use under **Offers for you** on their home page, with the uses and places left. Coupons are listed with their code, and offered at checkout, one tap to apply. For a code meant only for particular people, switch **Show in "Offers for you"** off (migration [`20261015100000_promotion_show_in_offers.sql`](../supabase/migrations/20261015100000_promotion_show_in_offers.sql)); the list marks it **Not in offers**.
- **Earnings** has a **Promo cost** column and the Overview shows what promotions cost Cydex in the period, commission promotions included. The row still adds up: customer paid = vendor + rider + Cydex.
- Batches of rider requests aren't discounted.

#### Vendor partnerships

**Admin → Promotions → Vendor partnerships.** Migration [`20261025100000_partnerships_and_order_radius.sql`](../supabase/migrations/20261025100000_partnerships_and_order_radius.sql).

- **Partner vendors:** add a vendor, then optionally give them their own **commission on sales** and **rider request commission** (0–50%). Leave either empty for the standard rate from Pricing. Switching a partner off, or removing them, puts them back on the standard rates. New rates apply to orders settled from then on.
- **Partnership promotions:** like a general promotion, but always for customers, on the delivery fee or Service Charge, and only on orders from the vendors you add. Customers see them under Offers for you with the vendors' names.

### Rewards

Migration [`20261024200000_rewards.sql`](../supabase/migrations/20261024200000_rewards.sql). **Admin → Rewards → New reward.** How rewards are earned and paid: [ORDER_FLOW.md → Rewards](ORDER_FLOW.md#rewards).

| Field | Choices |
|---|---|
| **Title** and **write-up** | What people see. Without a write-up they see the goal ("Complete 10 orders"). |
| **Who it's for** | Customers, vendors or riders. This decides what it can count. |
| **Type** | **Achievement** (earned once), or for riders a **Daily challenge** or **Weekly challenge** (progress starts again each day, or each Monday, Nigerian time; earned once per day or week). |
| **What it counts** | **Customers:** orders completed, amount spent. **Vendors:** orders completed, amount sold. **Riders:** deliveries completed, distance covered, time online (in hours), new fastest delivery. |
| **Reward** | A **wallet bonus** in naira, or a **discount offer**: what it takes money off (as for promotions, without items), the discount, how many orders it covers and how many days they have to use it. |
| **Icon** and **colour** | Shown next to the reward on the user's side. |
| **Dates** | Start (required) and end (optional). Progress counts from the start, so a start in the past counts earlier activity. |
| **Active** | Off hides it and stops it being earned. |

- The list shows each reward's state (scheduled, running, ended, off), who it's for, and how many times and by how many people it's been earned, with the total paid in wallet bonuses.
- **Money → Rewards** lists every reward given in a period, newest first: who got it, what for, and the wallet bonus (or "Offer"). Totals at the top: rewards given, paid into wallets, offers given.
- Editing a reward doesn't take back rewards already given.
- Offers given as rewards are personal (only the winner can use them) and aren't listed under Promotions.

#### Referrals

**Admin → Rewards → Referrals.** Migration [`20261025000000_referrals.sql`](../supabase/migrations/20261025000000_referrals.sql). How referrals work: [ORDER_FLOW.md → Referrals](ORDER_FLOW.md#referrals).

- One card each for customers, vendors and riders: the reward, the goal (vendors: sales, or rider requests), and **On** or **Paused**. While paused, codes can't be used and nothing is paid.
- Below, every referral with who referred whom, the code, progress and the reward paid, filtered by kind and status, with totals.
- Referral rewards are also listed under **Money → Rewards** ("Referral: Ada joined").

### Broadcasts

Migration [`20261014200000_broadcasts.sql`](../supabase/migrations/20261014200000_broadcasts.sql). **Admin → Broadcasts → New broadcast.**

| Field | Choices |
|---|---|
| **Title** and **Message** | Up to 80 and 2,000 characters. A phone notification shows about the first 180 characters of the message. |
| **Send as** | A notification in the app (which also goes out as a push to people who have push on), an email, or both |
| **Send to** | Customers, vendors, riders, or any mix |
| **Where** | Everyone in those groups, or only people near a place: pick the point on the map or search for an address, then set the radius in km |
| **When** | Now, or at a set time |

- **"Near a place"** means the person has a saved address inside the circle (a customer's delivery addresses, a vendor's store, a rider's home), or, for riders, their last known location is inside it.
- **The form shows how many people it reaches** before you send.
- **Scheduled broadcasts** are sent by a job that runs every minute (`send-due-broadcasts`), and can be cancelled until then. A sent broadcast can't be taken back.
- **Emails** use the Cydex email template (the "announcement" layout) and go only to people who haven't turned email notifications off. Suspended accounts are skipped.
- The list shows when each went out and to how many people.

### Business and product categories

**Admin → Verifications → Business categories.** A business category (Restaurant, Shop) has its own list of **product categories** that its vendors choose from when adding a product. A new business category needs at least one product category, and the last one can't be removed.

## Order details

`admin_order_detail()` returns everything on one page:

- **People:** customer (or, for rider requests, the recipient's name and phone), vendor and rider, each with a tap-to-call phone number.
- **Route:** pickup and drop-off addresses, directions, distance, and the note or package details.
- **Items** (customer orders only).
- **Money:** what was paid and how, then the split (expected while held, final once delivered).
- **Wallet movements** for this order.
- **Timeline:** every step with its time, including who cancelled it and why.
- **Handover codes:** status only (used, wrong tries, locked). Admins never see the digits.
- **Ratings** for this order, and every **admin action** taken on it.

Actions:

- **Cancel & refund** (any open order, with a reason). `admin_cancel_order` cancels the order and its delivery, and refunds through `refund_order`: to the customer's wallet, or to the vendor's for a rider request. The customer, vendor and rider are told "Cancelled by Cydex" with the reason.
- **Relieve or reassign the rider:** see [ORDER_FLOW.md → Admin tools](ORDER_FLOW.md#admin-tools).
- **Unlock a code** after 5 wrong tries (`admin_unlock_handover_code`).

## Users

- **Suspend a customer** (with a reason): `admin_set_customer_suspended`. They see an **Account suspended** screen with the reason, get a notification and an email, and the database refuses new orders from them. **Reinstate** lifts it.
- **Vendors and riders** are suspended through Verifications, so their store or deliveries stop too.
- **Edit name and phone** for anyone.
- **Invite an admin:** enter their name and email (one that doesn't already have a Cydex account).
  - The `admin-team` Edge Function sends Supabase's invite email and makes the new account an admin.
  - The link opens **/auth/set-password**, where they choose a password and land in the admin dashboard. After that they log in normally.
  - Sign-up itself can never create an admin.
- **Resend an invite** (it replaces the old link), **cancel an invite**, or **remove admin access**. A removed admin keeps their login as a regular customer. You can't remove yourself or the last admin.

## Reviews

**Hide** a review with a reason (`admin_set_review_hidden`):

- It stays in the database.
- Only its author and admins can see it.
- It no longer counts in the vendor's or rider's average.

**Show** reverses this.

## Emails

The **Emails** page lists `email_outbox`, failed emails first. **Retry** (`admin_retry_email`) puts a failed email back in the queue; `send-emails` sends it within a minute.

## Activity log

Every admin action is written to `audit_logs` with the admin, what they did, the target and the reason or values. This covers verification decisions, cancellations, relieving and reassigning riders, unlocking codes, approving and rejecting withdrawals, pricing changes, suspensions, hiding reviews, email retries and admin invites.

## Deploying

```
npx -y supabase@2.118.0 db push --linked
npx -y supabase@2.118.0 functions deploy squad-payout admin-team send-push
```

In Supabase → Authentication → URL Configuration, add `https://<domain>/auth/set-password` to the redirect URLs. Invites and password resets both land there.
