# Vendor and Rider Verification

How vendors and riders get onto Cydex: onboarding, the verification statuses, what each status allows, and how admins review. As of October 2026.

Database: migration [`20261007000000_verification.sql`](../supabase/migrations/20261007000000_verification.sql), table `verifications`.

## Onboarding

Everyone confirms their email first: after sign-up (customers, vendors and riders) a **Check your email** page (`/auth/check-email`) explains the confirmation link and can resend it once a minute. Logging in before confirming resends the link and shows the same page. The link brings them back to the login page.

Every vendor and rider, new or existing, goes through onboarding before using the dashboard. Logging in sends them to `/vendor/onboarding` or `/rider/onboarding` until they've submitted it.

| Vendors provide | Riders provide |
|---|---|
| **Store name** (what customers see; saved as their profile name) | **Phone number** |
| **Phone number** | **Home address** (pin-drop) |
| **Store logo** (and an optional banner; both editable in Settings → Account) | **Vehicle type**, from the admin's list (walking, bicycle, petrol bike, electric bike). Walking needs nothing else. The others need the **colour** and a **photo of the vehicle**, and, where the admin requires it, the **registration number** and a **registration document** |
| **Business category** (from the admin's list: Restaurant or Shop) | **Government ID:** National ID, passport, voter's card or driver's licence, plus a photo or scan |
| **Opening hours** for each day and **preparation time** (also in Settings → Hours) | |
| **Registered business?** If yes, a **business licence** upload | |

Documents go to the private `verification-docs` storage bucket. Only the user and admins can open them. Uploads are limited to PDF, PNG, JPG or WebP files of up to 5 MB.

Riders see their vehicle details and documents in **Profile**, and can update them there. Changing them sends the account back for review, with a warning first.

## Statuses

| Status | Vendor | Rider |
|---|---|---|
| *(not onboarded)* | Sent to onboarding | Sent to onboarding |
| `pending` | **Uploaded a licence:** sees the "Awaiting verification" screen and is told to watch their email. A vendor who was already trading as unverified keeps trading while their licence is reviewed. | Always pending after submitting. Sees "Awaiting verification". |
| `unverified` | **No licence:** full dashboard access straight away. Listed to customers **without** the verified badge. Can apply later from Settings → **Get verified**. | – |
| `verified` | Full access, with the **verified badge** on their cards and store page. | Full access. Can see and accept orders. |
| `rejected` | Sees the reason and **Edit and resubmit**, which returns them to `pending`. | Same. |
| `suspended` | Sees the reason; no access until reinstated. | Same; also set offline. |

**What the database enforces**, not just the screens:
- Only vendors who are `verified` or `unverified` (or pending while already trading) are listed to customers, can receive orders, can accept orders, or can request riders.
- Only `verified` riders see available orders, get "order nearby" alerts, or can accept deliveries.

Customers see **Verified** or **Unverified** on every vendor card and store page, and can filter the vendor list with **Verified only**.

## Emails

Vendors and riders are emailed at each step (migration [`20261013500000_verification_emails.sql`](../supabase/migrations/20261013500000_verification_emails.sql)), unless they've turned email notifications off:

| When | Email |
|---|---|
| They submit documents for review | "We're reviewing your details" |
| An admin verifies them | "You're verified" |
| An admin rejects the request | "Your verification wasn't approved", with the reason and how to resubmit |
| An admin suspends them | "Your account is suspended", with the reason |
| An admin reinstates them | "Your account is active again" |

A vendor who registers without a licence goes live as unverified straight away and gets no review email.

## Admin review

Admin sidebar → **Verifications**:
- **Requests:** filter by status (pending first) and by vendors or riders. Open a request to see everything submitted, the address, and the licence or ID document.
- **Actions:**
  - **Verify:** from pending, unverified or rejected.
  - **Reject:** from pending, with a **required reason**. A vendor who was trading as unverified goes back to unverified, not blocked.
  - **Suspend:** any time, with a **required reason**.
  - **Reinstate:** a suspended account returns to its status before the suspension.
- Each decision notifies the user in the app and queues an email (approved, rejected with the reason, suspended with the reason). Admins get a notification for every new request.
- **Business categories** tab: add categories, or switch one off for new sign-ups.

The older flags `profiles.verified` and `rider_profiles.is_verified` / `verification_status` are kept in sync automatically.
