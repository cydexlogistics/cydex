# Notification Settings and Push

How users choose between email and push, and how push notifications are delivered. As of October 2026. For what triggers each notification, see [ORDER_FLOW.md → Notifications](ORDER_FLOW.md#notifications).

Database: migration [`20261007100000_notification_settings_and_push.sql`](../supabase/migrations/20261007100000_notification_settings_and_push.sql).

## Settings

Every user has two switches. Customers find them in Profile → Preferences, vendors in Settings → Preferences, and riders in Profile → Personal.

| Setting | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| **Email notifications** | On, for every new account | Off: nothing is queued in `email_outbox` for them (welcome, payment, refund, verification emails) |
| **Push notifications on this device** | Off | On: notifications also arrive as browser/phone notifications, even with Cydex closed |

- **In-app notifications are always on.**
- **Notifications page:** the page for each role shows **Allow push notifications** until push is on for that device.
- **Vendors:** see a reminder banner on every dashboard page until push is on: "Turn on push notifications so you don't miss customer orders". It's a reminder, never a block.
- **Riders:** the same banner: "Turn on push notifications to hear about orders near you, even when you're offline". New-order alerts reach riders who are offline too (see [ORDER_FLOW.md → Statuses](ORDER_FLOW.md#statuses)), but only on devices with push on.

## Where push works

- **Android, Windows, Mac and Linux:** Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari on Mac.
- **iPhone and iPad:** only once Cydex is **added to the Home Screen** and opened from there. The app explains this instead of offering a switch that can't work.
- **Blocked notifications:** if someone denied the browser's prompt, the app tells them to allow notifications in their browser settings.

## How it works

1. **Turning push on:** the browser asks permission. The service worker `public/sw.js` is already registered on every visit (see `docs/INSTALLABLE_APP.md`), so the app just saves the device's subscription with `register_push_subscription`. The subscription is stored in `push_subscriptions`, one row per browser or device.
2. **Sending:** every new row in `notifications` calls the `send-push` Edge Function through `pg_net`, for users with push on.
3. **Delivery:** `send-push` reads the notification itself and sends it once (`notifications.push_sent_at`) to that user's devices. It removes subscriptions that browsers report as expired.
4. **Tapping it:** opens the matching order page, or the Notifications page.

A push that can't be sent never blocks the notification itself.

**Announcements:** admins can send their own notifications and emails to customers, vendors or riders, everywhere or near a place, from **Admin → Broadcasts** ([ADMIN.md → Broadcasts](ADMIN.md#broadcasts)). They arrive like any other notification and respect the same two switches.

### Badge on the app icon

The installed app's icon shows the number of unread notifications. It's set while the app is open and again by the service worker whenever a push arrives. Phones only show numbers, so it stops at **9** (the app itself shows "9+"). It clears when everything is read. It works where the browser supports app badges: installed apps on Android, Windows and Mac, and on iPhone once added to the Home Screen with notifications allowed.

## Sound

- **App open:** a short chime plays with the pop-up ([`src/lib/notificationSound.ts`](../src/lib/notificationSound.ts)). Urgent notifications get a longer chime:
  - **Customers:** your rider is around
  - **Vendors:** new order
  - **Riders:** order nearby, order assigned by an admin
  - **Admins:** withdrawal to approve, verification to review

  Browsers only allow sound after the person has tapped the page once, so there's no chime before then. The push notification shown at the same time is silent, so there's no double sound.
- **App closed:** the phone plays its **own** notification sound. Browsers don't let a website choose the sound; a custom one needs a native app. Android also vibrates: a longer pattern for urgent ones, which stay on screen until tapped. iPhones ignore vibration and use their own settings.
- **No sound?** Check the phone isn't on silent or Do Not Disturb, and that Cydex's notifications aren't muted in the phone's settings (Android: Settings → Apps → Cydex or Chrome → Notifications; iPhone: Settings → Notifications → Cydex).

## Setup (once per Supabase project)

- **VAPID keys:** the standard Web Push signing keys, generated with `npx web-push generate-vapid-keys`.
  - The public key goes in `VITE_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY`.
  - Both keys go in the function secrets:
    ```
    npx supabase secrets set VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=... VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=... VAPID_SUBJECT=mailto:you@your-domain
    ```
  - Never put the private key in a `VITE_` variable.
- **Deploy:** `npx supabase functions deploy send-push`
- **Functions URL:** `app_config.functions_url` must point at the project's functions, `https://<project-ref>.supabase.co/functions/v1`. It's set for the current project; change it on a new one.
